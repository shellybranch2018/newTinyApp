# TinyApp
# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product



## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Special Note
This TinyApp project was moved to this new repo because merging issues was causing the app to break, forcing me to comb through the commit messages and attached files to restore functionality back to its finished state. A list of the commits can be seen in the original repo (https://github.com/shellybranch2018/TinyApp).
